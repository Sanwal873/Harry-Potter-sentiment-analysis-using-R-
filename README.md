Our main focus will be on the three leads "Harry", "Hermione", "Ron" journey over the book, How their sentiments change as we move ahead in the book.

# Intoduction:
I used R programming  to perform sentimental analysis and to create social network maps for the characters of Harry Potter Book 2.

For the purpose of sentiment analysis, we divided the film into acts
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets follows a three act structure

Act 1 ends when the status quo is broken
A petrified student is found at Hogwarts

Act 2 ends when the mystery is solved
Aragog reveals Hagridâ€™s innocence

Act 3 is the resolution of the conflict within the film
Tom Riddle & the basilisk are defeated
The students are given the Mandrake Draught

# Methodology:
For Sentiment Analysis :
Divided the script into 3 Acts
Entire script sentiment analysis conducted 
NRC and BING lexicon utilized 

For Social Network Analysis :
Create 2 Vectors
Speakers/Listeners (Nodes)
Lines of Dialogue (Edges)
Use betweenness() to determine node size, clearly identifying major characters
Generated individual maps for our three protagonists and antagonists

# Text cleaning and preprocessing our data:
 To use the script of Book 2 for sentimental analysis, we must clean our data and perform several preprocessing task such as removing stopwords, removing any alphanemuric characters and number , lemmatization and stemming.
  
 # End Notes:
